Firstly , we know that css can be applied inline, internal, external through some external file .

Inline css : is when style is applied in the element attributes itself , and this has the highest
priority against external and internal css.

Internal css : is when css is applied in <style></style> tag in the same html file 
External css : is applied through an external file css .and linked to the html file 
in this way : <link href: path of stylesheet rel:stylesheet>

highest priority is for inline css and between external and internal css 
it depends what is read last , if external css is linked at last then external css will be applied finally 

************************* Selectors *************************************

1. universal Selectors : with this style will be applied to all the elements in the html file .
                          *{
                            key:value 
                          }

2. element Selectors : Selectors with the same name as html elements, with this style will be applied
                        to all the elements of same class.
                        for ex h1 Selector will apply the style to all the h1 elements in the html.

3. class selectors : with this grouping of html elements can be done and particular style
                     can be applied to that group . class attribute has to be given to the html elements 

                    ex - .classname {
                        apply css here
                    }

4. id selectors : id given to the html elements are unique to every html element.

#id {
    apply the style here
}

5. element selectors can be used with same body .
h1,p{
    color:blue;
}


Ways to insert colors in css .

1. color : red,blue  or orange // we can directly state the color names.

2. color:rgb(o to 255,0to 255,0 to 255)

3. color : rgba(0-255,0-255,0-255,0-1) // last part is about transparency

4. color : # 000000 // represents red-00, green-00, blue -00


Background :

some properties are : 

background-color
background-image:url(path of image)
background-size : cover or 100% 100% means talking about height and width
background-repeat : no-repeat
background-position : center
background-attachment : fixed
we can use shorthand to represent all these values in one line 

background : color url() center center/cover no-repeat fixed

Border :

border-style , border-radius, border-width = top value,rightvalue,bottom,leftvalue, border-color : top,right ,bottom,left
we can use shorthand for above 

border : 2px solid black or border-bottom seperately can be used
