Firstly , we know that css can be applied inline, internal, external through some external file .

Inline css : is when style is applied in the element attributes itself , and this has the highest
priority against external and internal css.

Internal css : is when css is applied in <style></style> tag in the same html file 
External css : is applied through an external file css .and linked to the html file 
in this way : <link href: path of stylesheet rel:stylesheet>

highest priority is for inline css and between external and internal css 
it depends what is read last , if external css is linked at last then external css will be applied finally 

************************* Selectors *************************************

1. universal Selectors : with this style will be applied to all the elements in the html file .
                          *{
                            key:value 
                          }

2. element Selectors : Selectors with the same name as html elements, with this style will be applied
                        to all the elements of same class.
                        for ex h1 Selector will apply the style to all the h1 elements in the html.

3. class selectors : with this grouping of html elements can be done and particular style
                     can be applied to that group . class attribute has to be given to the html elements 

                    ex - .classname {
                        apply css here
                    }

4. id selectors : id given to the html elements are unique to every html element.

#id {
    apply the style here
}

5. element selectors can be used with same body .
h1,p{
    color:blue;
}


Ways to insert colors in css .

1. color : red,blue  or orange // we can directly state the color names.

2. color:rgb(o to 255,0to 255,0 to 255)

3. color : rgba(0-255,0-255,0-255,0-1) // last part is about transparency

4. color : # 000000 // represents red-00, green-00, blue -00


Background :

some properties are : 

background-color
background-image:url(path of image)
background-size : cover or 100% 100% means talking about height and width
background-repeat : no-repeat
background-position : center
background-attachment : fixed
we can use shorthand to represent all these values in one line 

background : color url() center center/cover no-repeat fixed

Border :

border-style , border-radius, border-width = top value,rightvalue,bottom,leftvalue, border-color : top,right ,bottom,left
we can use shorthand for above 

border : 2px solid black or border-bottom seperately can be used  

**** Box Model ****

-> Essential components are : Content,padding,border,margin,height,width
-> margin : top right bottom left this way u can write all the margin in top left right bottom at smae time 
-> same applies for writing padding in same line for all directions.


**** Text Formatting *****

-> text-align : center for putting content in center
                left for putting content in left
                right for putting content in right
                justify for making all content occupy all the space equally looks good.

-> direction : ltr or rtl (left to right or right to left way text appears)
-> text-decoration-line : overline or underline will put line accordingly.
->text-decoration-style : can be dashed or dotted etc
-> text-decoration-thickness: thickness of line underline in text
-> text-transform : capitalize will capitalize all the first letter of a word , also other values
are there like lower case and uppercase.
-> text-indent : will add indentation to first word can be 50px or 30px etc
-> letter spacing : will add spacing between letters. just put 20px
-> word spacing : will add spacing between words . just put 20px
->text-shadow : 2px(horizontal shadow) 2px(vertical shadow) 5px(blur) orange color of shadow

******* Fonts ***********

-> font-size : will set the size of font 
-> font-family : will set the style of text /font
-> font-weight : lighter or bold
-> font-style : can italic or oblique etc

***** Links ******
these are some elements which can be added to anchor tags
-> color:
->text-decoration:none will remove underline of anchor text
-> background-color: yellow 
-> a:visited: u can set any color for those links which are alread visited.
-> a:active : this is to set color of anchor link when it being clicked
-> a:hover : this is to set color when we hover mouse on this link.

***** Display ****
-> display : inline , when u want some block level element to behave as inline element it helps
-> display : block , this will make element behave as block level element
-> display : hidden , this will completely disappear the element from the web page.
-> visibility : hidden , this will hide the element but element will be there in the web page it will still occupy the space

***** Position ******
This about positioning of child with respect to its parent child.

If we put position : static for child element it maintains default position even if we try to add spacing 
top : 10px left : 50px This will not change the position.

2. position : relative 
then child element will maintain spacing accordingly to parent element 

3. position : fixed 
-> when thsi given, if we give spacing it will space itself accoding to root element 
-> It maintains its position even when we scroll.

4. Parent element : position-relative ; child element : position - absolute
now when we give spacing to child element it may overflow the parent 
to avoid overflowing in parent style we add overflow : scroll

5. position : sticky given to child element along with top : 10px

when we scroll the parent element , child elemeent becomes sticky to maintain top spacing of 10px
